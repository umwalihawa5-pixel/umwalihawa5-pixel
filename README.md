<h2>💁‍♀️ About Me</h2>
<p>
Hi, I’m Hawa Umwali, founder of SheRises-a platform dedicated to empowering women and amplifying their voices. My passion for gender equality (GCGO: SDG 5) drives my work, as I believe women should have equal opportunities to thrive in education, entrepreneurship, and leadership. Currently, I am specializing in Data Analytics to measure and strengthen the impact of empowerment initiatives. My goal is to become a Social Impact Data Analyst and program leader, helping organizations design solutions that truly change lives. Beyond work, I enjoy creating motivational content that inspires women to rise above challenges. You can connect with me on LinkedIn [www.linkedin.com/in/hawa-anathalie-552460343].</p>
